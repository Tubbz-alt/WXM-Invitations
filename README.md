Send SMS and Email Invitations for Cisco WXM

About

In an economy where customer experience trumps price and product, the Cisco Webex Experience Management (referred to as Experience Management here on in the document) platform helps organizations exceed customer expectations and deliver business outcomes through its three pillars of customer experience:
	Measuring the customer journey: Understanding the customer experience through a continuous collection of moments across their journey.
	Obtaining a 360-degree view of the customer: Bringing disparate data together to enable actionable insights, proactive support and advanced marketing automation.
	Becoming predictive: Understanding predictively how changes to the customer experience will affect outcomes and impact financial metrics.

One of the key steps in measuring customer experience is to reach out to customers over various channels such as email, SMS, web intercept etc to solicit feedback. Amongst all the survey distribution channels, email and SMS are 2 of the popular ones.

Global delivery invitation management enables a personalized experience for receiving survey invitations across various channels on the journey using workflows that can be configured and reused across chosen transmission channels like SMS and Email while requiring no PII information in the Experience Management platform.
